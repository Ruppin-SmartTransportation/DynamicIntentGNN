**Intent-Aware Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Vehicle-Level Traffic Forecasting**

---

## üî¨ Research Contributions

1. **Dynamic Vehicle-Junction Graph Representation**  
   We introduce a novel graph-based representation of urban traffic in which both *vehicles* and *junctions* are modeled as graph nodes. This enables fine-grained, vehicle-level forecasting and allows the graph to dynamically evolve as vehicles move.

2. **User Intent Integration**  
   Unlike previous work that treats traffic as an aggregate process, we incorporate *user intent* in the form of GPS-based source-destination requests. This allows our model to predict not just current traffic but anticipated future congestion along users‚Äô likely paths.

3. **Path-Aware Spatio-Temporal Modeling**  
   We propose a spatio-temporal graph architecture that conditions predictions on the inferred future trajectories of vehicles. This enables the model to capture both real-time state and projected traffic loads at future timestamps.

4. **Graph-Based Dataset for Intent-Aware Forecasting**  
   We design and release a new dataset composed of dynamic graph snapshots that capture both vehicle mobility and user destination information, enabling supervised learning of future traffic conditions along likely paths.

5. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**  
   We compare our model with several established spatio-temporal GNNs (DCRNN, ASTGCN, TGAT, etc.) and show that our intent-aware architecture significantly improves accuracy in predicting future ETA and congestion levels under realistic simulated traffic.

## üß† Custom Model: IA-STGNN

**Intent-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN)**

### Architecture Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Input Graph** | Nodes = {vehicles, junctions}, Edges = road segments + inferred movement paths |
| **Node Features** | Time-aware vehicle features (speed, heading, occupancy), junction state (load, signal status, etc.) |
| **Edge Features** | Distance, time delta, relative motion, path confidence (based on intent) |
| **Intent Encoder** | Encodes GPS source-destination request into a "trajectory likelihood" embedding |
| **Graph Encoder (GCN or GAT)** | Encodes each graph snapshot spatially |
| **Temporal Module (LSTM / GRU)** | Captures sequence of graph snapshots over time |
| **Trajectory Conditioning** | Conditions prediction on future path embedding (from Intent Encoder) |
| **Output** | ETA or congestion level at future time t along the path or next node(s) |
